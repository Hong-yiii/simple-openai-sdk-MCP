      "Here's what could be wrong with your Notion API token and connection:\n\n1. **Token Validity**: The token might have expired or been revoked. Verify its current status.\n   \n2. **Permissions**: The token might lack necessary permissions for the required operations. Check these permissions.\n\n3. **Account Issues**: The token might be linked with an incorrect or inactive account. Ensure it's associated with the correct and active account.\n\n4. **Network Connectivity**: There may be network issues preventing proper connection to Notion. Verify the network's stability and any potential blocks on the API.\n\nCheck these areas to troubleshoot and resolve the issue."

      "The `demo.py` file seems to be a script for an OpenAI agent with various features and tools. Here's a quick overview of the potential areas to check for issues:\n\n1. **Environment Variables**: The script requires the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable. Ensure that this key is set correctly in your environment.\n\n2. **Configuration File**: It looks for a `config.json` file to load MCP server configurations. Make sure this file exists in the specified directory and is formatted correctly.\n\n3. **MCP Servers Initialization**: During MCP server setup, some exceptions might occur, such as incorrect commands or arguments. The script prints error messages if servers fail to initialize.\n\n4. **Async Operations**: Check that the asynchronous operations are handled correctly. Asynchronous context management is used, which requires Python 3.7 or newer.\n\n5. **Command Handling**: The command processing logic is structured well, but unknown commands or other processing logic could cause unexpected behavior. \n\n6. **General Error Handling**: Various try-except blocks handle exceptions broadly. Double-check error messages to understand specific issues during runtime.\n\nIf you need further inspection or detailed debugging steps on specific functions, feel free to ask!"
